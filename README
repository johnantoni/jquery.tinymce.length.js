Sample code for TinyMCE control

Displays status bar at bottom showing how many characters left, if the limit is 
exceeded a copy of the previous input replaces the current one; stoping the user
from entering more.

Ok, not the best but works pretty well for something that's supposedly impossible 
to do, apparently ;-)

P.S.

Requires jQuery as it uses $(this).data() to store & retrieve a copy of the 
original input, based on the element's ID.


how to use?
-----------
change this.textLimit value to whatever you want as the limit for your textboxes

then create your textbox elements and add a class 'tinymce' to the one's you want
to embed the tinymce control with.
